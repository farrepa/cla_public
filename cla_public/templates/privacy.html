  <h1>Civil Legal Advice Privacy Statement</h1>
  <p>
    In order to provide a service to you, Civil Legal Advice (<abbr title="Civil Legal Advice">CLA</abbr>)
    may need to view, collect, record and hold (‘process’) personal data about you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personal data is information about you that can be used to identify you in some way
    e.g. your name or telephone number. You can look at the
    <a href="http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/the_guide/key_definitions#personal-data" rel="external" target="_blank">full legal definition</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <abbr title="Civil Legal Advice">CLA</abbr> is committed to protecting your personal data and respecting your privacy.
    We are legally bound by the Data Protection Act 1998 to ensure that we only use your personal
    data for the reasons we tell you about. We must also hold it securely.
  </p>
  <p>
    This statement explains how <abbr>CLA</abbr> will process any personal data that we collect
    from you or that you provide to us.
  </p>


  <h2>What is Civil Legal Advice?</h2>
  <p>
    <abbr title="Civil Legal Advice">CLA</abbr> is a national adviceline for England and Wales, paid for by Legal Aid.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Legal Aid Agency (<abbr title="The Legal Aid Agency">LAA</abbr>) is responsible for the <abbr>CLA</abbr>
    service and the Ministry of Justice (<abbr title="The Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr>) is the Data Controller
    for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998. They are responsible for determining the purposes for which
    and the manner in which any personal data are, or are to be processed.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a more comprehensive explanation see
    <a href="http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/the_guide/key_definitions#personal-data" rel="external" target="_blank">this guide</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The LAA works with other organisations who deliver the <abbr>CLA</abbr> service.
    For example when you first make contact with <abbr>CLA</abbr> you will communicate with
    the <abbr>CLA</abbr> Operator Service, which is delivered by Agilisys
    (a contractor employed by the <abbr title="The Legal Aid Agency">LAA</abbr> to [  ]).
  </p>
  <p>
    If after contacting the <abbr>CLA</abbr> Operator Service it is determined that you
    qualify for the <abbr>CLA</abbr> specialist advice service you may be put through
    to one of a number of <abbr>CLA</abbr> Specialist Advice Providers. If you do not qualify to receive
    <abbr>CLA</abbr> specialist advice we will inform you accordingly and
    direct you to alternative help.
  </p>
  <p>
    These organisations are Data Processors for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 which
    means that they process data on behalf of the <abbr>LAA</abbr> and <abbr title="The Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <abbr>CLA</abbr> service is committed to following this Privacy Statement.
    <abbr>CLA</abbr> Specialists must also adhere to their own internal privacy policy.
  </p>


  <h2>What data will <abbr>CLA</abbr> collect?</h2>
  <p>
    <abbr>CLA</abbr> will only collect the minimum amount of information necessary in order
    to deliver the <abbr>CLA</abbr> service to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    The kind of information <abbr>CLA</abbr> may collect about you includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Personal details including your name, address, date of birth, contact details, diversity
      monitoring information and national insurance number;
    </li>
    <li>

      Responses to any customer satisfaction survey or details of any feedback, complaints or requests
      for a review of our decision about whether you qualify for legal aid.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The amount of information <abbr>CLA</abbr> will collect will depend on whether you qualify for the <abbr>CLA</abbr>
    service and/or your specific needs. For example you will be asked to provide more information
    before we can transfer you through to a <abbr>CLA</abbr> Specialist.
