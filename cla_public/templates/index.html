  Can I get legal aid?
{% endblock %}

{% block page_subheading %}
  <p>Legal aid can help pay for legal advice, family mediation or representation in a court or tribunal. It only covers some types of problem.</p>
{% endblock %}

{% block inner_content %}
  <p>To get legal aid, you must qualify financially and have a relevant problem.</p>

  <p>If you qualify, you may be able to speak to a Civil Legal Advice operator about your problem at the end of this service. Civil Legal Advice is a national advice line for England and Wales, funded by legal aid.</p>

  <p><a href="{{ url_for('checker.problem') }}" id="start">Start</a></p>

  <h3>Before you start</h3>
  <p>To use this service, you’ll need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>last month’s payslips (if you’re working)</li>
    <li>last month’s bank statements</li>
    <li>details of any benefits you got last month</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You’ll only get guidance on whether or not you can get legal aid - you won’t get a final decision.</p>

  <p>Legal aid is different in <a href="http://www.slab.org.uk/public/civil/eligibility/" rel="external">Scotland</a> and <a href="http://www.dojni.gov.uk/index/public-consultations/current-consultations/consultation-on-scope-of-civil-legal-aid.htm" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

  <p>For more detail on whether your specific problem is covered by legal aid, use the <a href="#">GOV.UK legal aid checker</a></p>

  <p>This service is only for adults. If you’re under 18, <a href="#">talk to a solicitor about legal aid</a>.</p>

  <p>If you’ve been charged with a crime, this service doesn’t apply to you. Ask your solicitor about <a href="#">criminal legal aid</a>.</p>
