  <h1>You’re unlikely to get legal aid</h1>

  <p>Based on the answers you have given, it looks like you do not qualify
    financially for legal aid.</p>

  <p>You can still get free help and advice from the organisations listed
    below. You don’t have to qualify for legal aid to get help and advice
    from these organisations.</p>

  <p>You can also seek advice from a legal adviser - you will have to pay
    for this advice.</p>

  <p>If you have a court hearing date it is important that you get advice
    as soon as possible. You may be able to get last-minute help on the
    day of the hearing from an adviser in the court building.</p>
