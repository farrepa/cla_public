      Your CLA specialist adviser will ask you more questions before making the final decision about
      whether you qualify for legal aid.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will need to provide evidence of your financial circumstances and maybe your problem.
      Your CLA specialist adviser will explain what is needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your CLA specialist adviser takes your case on they will communicate with you by telephone,
      email or post.
    </p>

    <p>
      If CLA can't help we will always suggest other places that might be able to.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your Civil Legal Advice adviser decides that you need to speak to someone in person or if
      you need someone to represent you in court, they will organise this for you.
