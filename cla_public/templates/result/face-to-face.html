      If your employment problem relates to discrimination (for example, you have been treated
      unfairly because of your sex, age or other protected characteristic) we might be able to
      help. Please go back to <a href="/">start</a> page and click discrimination.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your employment problem is not connected to discrimination, legal aid is not usually available.

      <li>Advisery, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas)</li>
      <li>Law Centres Network</li>
    </ul>

      You can also seek advice from a legal adviser – you will have to pay for this advice.
