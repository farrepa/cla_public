  <p>Civil Legal Advice only handles problems that relate to certain categories of law. Your problem is about a category of law that we don't cover. </p>
  
 <p></p>You may be able to get legal aid, but you will need to speak to a solicitor who can take on your case. If you qualify for legal aid, you will not have to pay for the solicitor's advice. </p>
  <p>You can search for a solicitor in your area.</p>
