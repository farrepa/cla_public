  <p>Civil Legal Advice only handles problems that relate to certain categories of law.
    Your problem is about a category of law that we don't cover.</p>

  <p>You may be able to get legal aid, but you will need to speak to a solicitor who can
    take on your case. If you qualify for legal aid, you will not have to pay for the
    solicitor's advice. </p>
  <p>You can search for a solicitor in your area.</p>
