  <h2>What happens next?</h2>

    Your details have been submitted and an operator will call you back
    around the time you requested
    (<strong>{{ session.time_to_callback|datetime('full') }}</strong>).

  {% if category in ['debt', 'housing', 'violence', 'discrimination', 'education', 'family'] %}
    <p>
      We will try and call you once. If we cannot speak to you we will
      leave you a message unless you have said it is unsafe to do so.
    </p>

    {% if category == 'violence' %}
      <p>
        If you need to urgently protect you or your family you should
        try and get advice as soon as possible.

      <p>
        If you have a court hearing date it is important that you get
        advice as soon as possible. You may be able to get last-minute
        help on the day of the hearing from an adviser in the court building.

    <p>
      Your CLA specialist adviser will ask you more questions before
      making the final decision about whether you qualify for legal aid.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will need to provide evidence of your financial circumstances
      and maybe your problem. Your CLA specialist adviser will explain
      what is needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your CLA specialist adviser takes your case on they will
      communicate with you by telephone, email or post.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your CLA adviser decides that you need to speak to someone in
      person or if you need someone to represent you in court, they
      will organise this.
    </p>
  {% else %}
    <p>
      If the operator you speak to thinks you can get legal aid, they will find
      you specialist legal help, like a phone call with a solicitor or
      support from a family mediation service.
    </p>
