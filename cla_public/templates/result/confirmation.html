  <h3>What happens next?</h3>
  <p>
    Your details have been submitted and an operator will call you back
    around the time you requested
    (<strong>{{ session.time_to_callback|datetime('full') }}</strong>).
    If the operator you speak to thinks you can get legal aid, they will find
    you specialist legal help, like a phone call with a solicitor or
    support from a family mediation service.
  </p>

  <h3>What if I miss the operatorâ€™s call?</h3>
  <p>
   If you miss the call or are in an emergency, you can call us on 0845 345 4 345. Calls cost no more than 4p a minute from a BT landline. Calls from mobiles usually cost more.
